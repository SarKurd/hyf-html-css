            <h2> Dolma </h2>
            <p class="text-info"> Dolma is a family of stuffed vegetable dishes common 
                in the Mediterranean cuisine and surrounding regions including the Balkans,
                the Caucasus, Russia, Central Asia and Middle East. Common vegetables to stuff 
                include tomato, pepper, onion, zucchini, eggplant, and garlic. Meat dolmas are 
                generally served warm, often with tahini or egg-lemon sauce. Dolmas prepared with
                olive oil and stuffed with rice are generally served cold with a garlic-yogurt sauce.
                Stuffed vegetables are also common in Greek cuisine, called gemista, as well as in Italian cuisine,
                where they are named ripieni ("stuffed"). Dishes of cabbage or grape leaves wrapped around a 
                filling have been known since antiquity, where in ancient Greece they were called 
                "fyllas" (Greek: φύλλον 'leaf'), and currently are called dolmadaki or in general dolma or
                yaprak dolma ('leaf dolma'), and are also used to make sarma.

    <h2>Directions</h2>
        
            <p class="text-info"><strong class="strong-head">Step 1:</strong><br>
            Prepare + carve the vegetables. (Beating the onion loosens the skin and separates the layers) Cut the onions, 
            eggplants, and squash into large chunks or in half,
             and hollow them out. Optional: Cut meat into smallish chunks. Wash all the leafy greens (grape leave, etc.)
            </p>
            
            <p class="text-info"><strong class="strong-head">Step 2:</strong><br> After the vegetables are washed (including the rice),
             it’s time to prepare your rice mixture. The filling consists of uncooked rice, chopped onions, herbs,
              spices, tomato paste, tomato cubes, pieces of meat (if you’d like) salt and hot oil. (optional: you 
              can cook meat separately) </p>

            <p class="text-info"><strong class="strong-head">Step 3:</strong> <br> Fill the Vegetables! (the fun part) The onion and grape
                leaves are rolled and tucked, to make little pocket-shaped packets.
                After everything is stuffed, the top of the pot is covered with more grape leaves and salt.
                 Then add some boiling water and cook it over medium-flame.
